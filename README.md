# $\text{Deep Computer Vision With CNNs}$
- This notebook explain CNN
- Using NN for image processing directly needs so much of resources (CPU & RAM) and it is not practical to process a very high quality of images to train a model.
- CNN helps to extract features and helps to identify important features by using concept of filters, feature map, pooling and then integrate with fully connected Neural Network.
